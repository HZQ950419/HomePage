(Last Updated: Oct 10, 2023)

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. student at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Roy Ka-Wei Lee. My research interests encompass various domains, including Text Style Transfer, Large Language Models, and Math Word Problem Solving. Before that, I got my master's degree on Computer Science at the UESTC, where I was supervised by Prof. Dai Bo. My undergraduate studies were also at UESTC, where I earned my bachelor's degree on Applied Mathematics from the school of Mathematical Sciences.
